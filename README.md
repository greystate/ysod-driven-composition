# YSOD-Driven Composition

Source material for [my Skrift article](http://skrift.io/articles/archive/ysod-driven-composition/) on a special kind of composing.


The article was written in [Markdown][MD] using [iA Writer][IA] on **macOS** (at home) and **iOS** (on various means of transportation, mainly buses :-).
Writer adds a few extensions to Markdown, especially a nifty syntax for includes called [Content Blocks][CB] which I've
used for including the images.

The HTML is generated by Writer (I just hit <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> and then <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>) to
grab it all and then paste it in the `article.html` file. I haven't found a way to automate that, but who cares - it shouldn't
be necessary after Skrift has published it anyway.
