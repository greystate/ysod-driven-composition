# YSOD-Driven Composition

Source material for [my Skrift article](http://skrift.io/articles/archive/ysod-driven-composition/) on a special kind of composing.


The article was written in [Markdown][MD] using [iA Writer][IA] on **macOS** (at home) and **iOS** (on various means of transportation, mainly buses :-).
It adds a few extensions to Markdown, especially a nifty syntax for includes called [Content Blocks][CB] which I've
used for including the images.
